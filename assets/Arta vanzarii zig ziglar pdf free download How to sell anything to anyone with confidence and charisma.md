In this article, we will look at some of the key concepts and strategies that Zig Ziglar teaches in *Arta Vanzarii*. These are based on his own experience and research, as well as the best practices of other successful salespeople. We will also provide some examples and exercises to help you apply them in your own sales situations.
 
## The Art of Prospecting
 
Prospecting is the process of finding and qualifying potential customers for your product or service. It is the foundation of any sales career, as without prospects, you have no one to sell to. Zig Ziglar says that prospecting is not a numbers game, but a people game. You have to treat each prospect as an individual, not as a statistic.
 
There are many sources of prospects, such as referrals, cold calls, advertisements, social media, networking events, trade shows, etc. Zig Ziglar suggests that you should have at least three sources of prospects at any given time, and that you should constantly look for new ones. He also recommends that you keep a prospect list, where you record the names and contact details of your prospects, as well as some notes about their needs, interests, and preferences.
 
To qualify your prospects, you need to ask them some questions to determine if they have a need for your product or service, if they have the authority and ability to buy it, and if they are ready and willing to buy it. Zig Ziglar calls these questions the *NAAR* questions: Need, Authority, Ability, and Readiness. He says that you should ask these questions in a conversational and friendly way, not in a interrogative or pushy way.
 
For example, if you are selling life insurance, you could ask your prospect:

- Do you have a family or dependents who rely on your income?
- Who makes the financial decisions in your household?
- How much do you earn per month?
- How do you feel about your current level of protection?

By asking these questions, you can find out if your prospect has a need for life insurance, if they are the decision-maker or if they need to consult someone else, if they can afford your product or service, and if they are satisfied or dissatisfied with their current situation. Based on their answers, you can decide if they are a qualified prospect or not.
 
## The Art of Presenting
 
Presenting is the process of showing and telling your prospect how your product or service can solve their problem or fulfill their desire. It is the core of any sales presentation, as it is where you demonstrate the value and benefits of what you are offering. Zig Ziglar says that presenting is not about telling features, but about selling benefits. You have to show your prospect what's in it for them.
 
To present effectively, you need to tailor your presentation to your prospect's specific needs and wants. You need to use language that they understand and relate to. You need to use stories and testimonials that illustrate how your product or service has helped other people like them. You need to use visual aids and demonstrations that make your product or service come alive. And you need to use questions and feedback to involve your prospect in the presentation.
 
For example, if you are selling life insurance, you could present it like this:
 
"Mr. Jones, I understand that you have a wife and two children who depend on your income. You told me that you earn $5,000 per month and that you have no life insurance at all. Is that correct?"
 
"Yes, that's right."
 
"Well, let me ask you this: What would happen to your family if something happened to you? How would they pay the bills? How would they maintain their lifestyle? How would they cope with the emotional loss?"
 
"I don't know. I guess they would struggle a lot."
 
"I'm sure you don't want that to happen. That's why I'm here to help you. Let me show you how our life insurance policy can protect your family from financial hardship and give them peace of mind. Here is a brochure that explains how it works. And here is a testimonial from one of our clients who had a similar situation as yours. He was very happy with our service and our policy. And here is a calculator that shows how much coverage you need based on your income and expenses."
